Additionally, Hyundai produces key automotive parts such as transmissions and engines. /n Currently, Hyundai\u2019s lineup includes 13 models, ranging from sedans and hatchbacks to SUVs. In FY 2024, Hyundai captured approximately 15% of the domestic car market, securing the second position behind Maruti Suzuki. As of December 31, 2023, Hyundai Motor India boasted 1,366 sales outlets and 1,550 service centres across various cities and towns in India. This marked a significant expansion from March 31, 2021, when the company operated 1,167 sales outlets and 1,307 service centres. /n 4 million! That\u2019s how many cars Indians bought in 2023. In fact, we\u2019re the third-biggest car market globally, trailing only China and the US. With electric vehicles gaining popularity, experts predict India will have 2.5 million EVs on the roads by 2025, making us the third-largest EV market as well. Automakers are closely watching these developments and are eager to jump on this trend. /n Take Hyundai India, for instance. Despite being a subsidiary of South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Company, it has a rich history in the country. Hyundai India became a household name by manufacturing locally, overcoming early competition, and innovating for the Indian market. Now, they plan to take it further by raising a whopping \u20b925,000 crores through an IPO, potentially breaking previous IPO records held by LIC and PayTM. /n But wait\u2026 If Hyundai is a foreign brand, why pursue an IPO in the Indian market, you ask?",

Zepto\u2019s main appeal lies in its ability to deliver groceries and essentials in under 10 minutes, a model that has attracted significant investor interest. /n While Swiggy\u2019s Instamart was the first to start quick commerce, Zepto quickly captured consumer attention and market share. Despite entering the market after competitors like Swiggy, Zepto has swiftly captured market share, with plans to expand into 40-50 cities. Its rapid adoption rate is a key differentiator. /n Zepto has raised $1.6 billion across nine funding rounds from 52 investors, including big names like General Catalyst, StepStone Group, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. As of its latest funding round in August 2024, Zepto was valued at $5 billion. This sharp rise in valuation reflects the strong backing it has received, even during a challenging \u201cfunding winter\u201d in the tech world. /n Unlike competitors such as Blinkit, which is backed by Zomato, and Instamart (Swiggy), Zepto is the only major quick commerce player funded purely by financial investors. /n In terms of sales, Zepto has been gaining traction, with a Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of $1.5 billion as of July 2024. The company operates a network of dark stores\u2014micro-warehouses strategically located in high-demand areas to facilitate its lightning-fast deliveries. As of August 2024, Zepto was processing approximately 650,000 orders per day and aimed to ramp up this number to 900,000 during the festive season. /n Its average order value (AOV) has also increased steadily, contributing to rising revenues. In FY23, Zepto reported operating revenues of \u20b92,024 crore but incurred a net loss of \u20b91,272 crore, highlighting the challenges in making the quick commerce model profitable. /n Zepto aims to break even by the September 2024 quarter, as its EBITDA margins move towards positive territory. Each dark store processes up to 2,000 orders per day, and new dark stores are reportedly reaching profitability within 9 months, which is a significant improvement. /n Zepto plans to expand beyond groceries into higher-value categories like electronics and home goods, which could help boost its gross sales and profit margins. However, despite its rapid growth and consumer adoption, profitability remains elusive\u2014a challenge faced by most players in the quick commerce space globally. /n Despite this rapid expansion, however, quick commerce has only captured a modest 7% of the potential market, with a total addressable market (TAM) estimated at $45 billion.",
